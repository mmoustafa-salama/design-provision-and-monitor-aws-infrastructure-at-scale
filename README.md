# Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale
In this project, I plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. I practice the skills you have learned throughout the Udacity Cloud Architect course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. I also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

## Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics
### Part 1
You have been asked to plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrastructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services. Please include your name and label all elements of the infrastructure on the diagram.

- Infrastructure in the following regions: `us-east-1`
- Users and Client machines
- One VPC
- Two Availability Zones
- Four Subnets (2 Public, 2 Private)
- A NAT Gateway
- A CloudFront distribution with an S3 bucket
- Web servers in the Public Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
- Application Servers in the Private Subnets sized according to your usage estimates
- DB Servers in the Private Subnets
- Web Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- Application Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2
Use LucidChart or a similar diagramming application to create your schematic. Export your schematic as a PDF and save as `Udacity_Diagram_1.pdf`.

### Part 2
You have been asked to plan a SERVERLESS architecture schematic for a new application development project. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services.

- A user and client machine
- AWS Route 53
- A CloudFront Distribution
- AWS Cognito
- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway
- DynamoDB
- S3 Storage
Export your schematic as a PDF and save as `Udacity_Diagram_2.pdf`

## Task 2: Calculate Infrastructure Costs
1. Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate how much it will cost to run the services in your Part 1 diagram for one month.
- Target a monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000.
- Be mindful of AWS regions when you are estimating costs.
- Export the estimate as a CSV file named `Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv`.

2. Return to the AWS Pricing Calculator and reconfigure your estimates for the following scenarios:

- Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500. What services will you modify to meet this new budget? Export the updated costs in a CSV file named `Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.

- Your budget has been increased to $20,000. What resources will you add and why?
Think about where to add redundancy and how to improve performance. Re-configure your estimate to a monthly invoice of $18K-20K. Export the updated costs to a CSV file named `Increased_Cost Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.

## [OPTIONAL] Task 3: Configure Permissions.
> Attempt this task only if you are using your personal AWS account. This task will not be graded.

In order to complete this task, please ensure your IAM users have been granted access to the billing dashboard (Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console).

1. Update the AWS password policy.

- Minimum password length = 8
- Require at least one uppercase letter
- Require at least one lowercase letter
- Require at least one number
- Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.
Submit a screenshot of the Password Policy from the IAM Account settings page. Name the screenshot `udacity_password_policy.png` or `udacity_password_policy.jpg`.

2. Create a Group named `CloudTrailAdmins` and give it the two `CloudTrail` privileges.

3. Create a Group named `Reviewers` and give it the `Billing` privilege.

4. Configure a user named `CloudTrail` and a user named `Accountant`. Give the users AWS Console access and assign them a password that conforms to your password policy. Require them to change their password when they login.

5. Assign `CloudTrail` to the `CloudTrailAdmins` group. Assign `Accountant` to the `Reviewers` group .

6. Test both user accounts by logging into the AWS console as the users `CloudTrail` and `Accountant` after changing their passwords on login. Login using your numerical AccountID

7. While logged-in as the user `CloudTrail`, go to the `CloudTrail` page and create a trail named `Udacity_Trail`. Enable logging on all Read/Writes Management Events and S3 and Lambda events Data Events. Create a new S3 Bucket to store the `CloudTrail` log. There is no need for advanced configuration.

8. Download the portion of the `CloudTrail` log that shows the entire Task 3 timeframe and save it as `UdacityCloudTrailLog.csv`.

9. Before Logging off, return to the CloudTrail configuration page. Disable S3 logging.

## [OPTIONAL ]Task 4: Set up Cost Monitoring
> Attempt this task only if you are using your personal AWS account. This task will not be graded.

1. Configure CloudWatch billing alarm

2. Set up a Billing alarm with a $5 threshold

3. Set up notification so that you get an email alert when the alarm is triggered.
Save a screenshot of the CloudWatch Alarms page showing the new alarm with a green OK status as `CloudWatch_alarm.png` or `CloudWatch_alarm.jpg`

## Task 5 : Use Terraform to Provision AWS Infrastructure
### Part 1
1. Download the starter code.
2. In the `main.tf` file write the code to provision
- AWS as the cloud provider
- Use an existing VPC ID
- Use an existing public subnet
- 4 AWS t2.micro EC2 instances named `Udacity T2`
- 2 m4.large EC2 instances named `Udacity M4`

3. Run Terraform.

4. Take a screenshot of the 6 EC2 instances in the AWS console. Save it as `Terraform_1_1.png` or `Terraform_1_1.jpg`.
5. Use Terraform to delete the 2 m4.large instances.
6. Take an updated screenshot of the AWS console showing only the 4 t2.micro instances and save it as `Terraform_1_2.png` or `Terraform_1_2.jpg`

### Part 2
1. In the `Exercise_2` folder, write the code to deploy an AWS Lambda Function using Terraform. Your code should include:
- A `lambda.py` file
- A `main.tf` file
- An `outputs.tf` file
- A `variables.tf` file

2. Take a screenshot of the EC2 instances page and save it as `Terraform_2_1.png` or `Terraform_2_1.jpg`.

3. Take a screenshot of the VPC page and save it as `Terraform_2_2.png` or `Terraform_2_2.jpg`.
4. Take a screenshot of the CloudWatch log entry for the lambda function execution and save it as `Terraform_2_3.png` or `Terraform_2_3.jpg`.


## Task 6: Destroy the Infrastructure using Terraform and prepare for submission
1. Destroy all running provisioned infrastructure using Terraform so as not to incur unwanted charges.
2. Take a screenshot of the EC2 instances page and label it `Terraform_destroyed.png` or `Terraform_destroyed.jpg` .
3. Upload Terraform files, screenshots, schematics and CSV files to your GitHub repo
